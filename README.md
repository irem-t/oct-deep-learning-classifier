# OCT Image Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

This project aims to classify retinal diseases from OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) images using deep learning. It includes both model training and a graphical user interface (GUI) for making predictions on new images.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from **Kaggle**:

ðŸ”— **[Retinal OCT Images (optical coherence tomography)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/obulisainaren/retinal-oct-c8)**

It contains 8 classes of retinal conditions:

- NORMAL
- DR (Diabetic Retinopathy)
- DRUSEN
- MH (Macular Hole)
- AMD (Age-related Macular Degeneration)
- CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization)
- CSR (Central Serous Retinopathy)
- DME (Diabetic Macular Edema)

All images are resized to **128x128** and converted to grayscale.

## Model

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following architecture:

- Conv2D (32 filters) + ReLU + MaxPooling
- Conv2D (64 filters) + ReLU + MaxPooling
- Flatten + Dense (64 units) + Output layer (Softmax)

Training settings:

- **Loss Function**: `sparse_categorical_crossentropy`
- **Optimizer**: `Adam`
- **Metrics**: `accuracy`
- **Epochs**: 10
- **Batch Size**: 32

The best model is saved as `best_model.h5`.

## GUI Application

The GUI is built using **Tkinter** and allows users to:

- Upload an OCT image
- Automatically classify it into one of 8 disease categories
- Display the prediction and confidence score
- View the selected image inside the application

### Supported Image Formats:
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`
